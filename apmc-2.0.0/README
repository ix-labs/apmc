How to use APMC ?

Download latest tarball
tar xvfz apmc-2.0.0.tar.gz
cd apmc-2.0.0
Edit apmc.conf file and set your personal settings
./apmc.sh property_file model_file strategy_name path_len nbpath hosts_file

-strategy_name
Only one strategy actually works fine.
"sync at compile-time"
But it exists 2 other strategies:
"sync at compile-time (PSoR)"
"sync at run-time"


-What really does apmc.sh ?
1) apmc.sh launches autogen.sh if you get APMC from svn.
2) launches configure scripts
3) launches compilation
4) copies property file, model file and host file in correct directory
5) launches APMC master file

-Syntax of hosts_file
One hostname (or IP address) by line. Lines beginning by // are ignored.

Some property and model files are available in apmc/example.
Example of use:
./apmc.sh apmc/examples/phil/phil25.p{rop,m} "sync at compile-time" 55 940000 hosts

- How to recompile ?
If you modify source code, there is an easy way to clean directory :
./apmc.sh clean
Tarball (for deployment) and compiled files are removed. They will be
-re-generated next time you launch ./apmc.sh
